CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Deprecation Warning at lemon/CMakeLists.txt:1 (CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED):

CMake Deprecation Warning at lemon/CMakeLists.txt:3 (CMAKE_POLICY):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0048 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
